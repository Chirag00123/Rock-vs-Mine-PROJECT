Rock vs. Mine Classification Project

This project leverages machine learning to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar signal data. The dataset used in this project includes sonar signals that have been recorded from various objects submerged in water. Each objectâ€™s sonar profile has unique characteristics due to the way sonar waves bounce back from different surfaces, allowing the model to distinguish between natural geological formations (rocks) and man-made objects (mines).

The primary objective is to train a model that can analyze these sonar returns and accurately classify the object type. This involves preprocessing the data, exploring various feature extraction techniques, and selecting a suitable algorithm for classification.
